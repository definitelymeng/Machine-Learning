# Machine-Learning
This folder contains machine learning projetcs I have finished.
- Titanic: A simple decision tree classifier to predict titanic survival
- Spam Filter: Applied three classifiers(Naive Bayes, KNN and SVC) to predict whether a SMS message is spam or not
- Finding Donors: Employed several supervised learning algorithms(Random Forest, AdaBoost and Logistic Regression) to predict whether an individual's income exceeds 50k. Used grid search to tune model parameters
- Image Classifier: Deep Learning classifier using PyTorch to classify flower images
- Hierarchical Clustering: Simple clustering model using three different hierarchical cluster methods
- Lastfm Data Analysis: Using Pandas library to conduct data analysis to understand user listening habits and artist similarites on user data from Lastfm
- Gradient Descent: Implemented gradient descent and backpropagation using numpy
